add logic for switching Metamask's connected network (ethereum/polygon) - [x]

add user input fields to have a user create the Metadata. - [x]

add user SVG submission - [x]

get new mint contracts for both polygon and ehtereum without the "is Ownable" - [x]

add logging event and user copy contract address + tokenID for ethereum

const toAddress = "0xEC5DBFed2e8A5E88De2AC7a9E5884B0bD4F6Ca7f"; should be changed to:
const toAddress = address(Signer); or address[Signer];? - [x]

add ASCII application. extra page or pop-up?
max size of image to convert?
png AND jpg?

# issue:

The switching of networks (polygon <--> ethereum) does not work properly if the user has not yet added the Polygon network!!!

inpage.js:1 MetaMask - RPC Error: gas required exceeds allowance (30000000) {code: -32000, message: 'gas required exceeds allowance (30000000)'}

     const tx = await contractWithSigner.mintNFT(userAddress, tokenUri, {
        gasLimit: 50000000,
      }); // Set the gasLimit (size: 36kb > 30000000 gas)

The above approach won't work, because the blocksize is exceeded for these bigger NFT's.

--> MetaMask - RPC Error: [ethjs-query] while formatting outputs from RPC '{"value":{"code":-32000,"message":"exceeds block gas limit"}}'

##   Now for the NEW and improve top layer: The average out of bitcoin application!

I'm going to build a free-to-use browser-based app that is a calculation tool for people that want to sell their bitcoin in chunks at different incremental prices. The tool will give the user insight in the resulting outcome tested against different scenario's. So there's basically two variables: 1: The specific users plan to (average out) sell bitcoin. 2: A potential scenario of price action in the future.

An example:
user has 10 BTC.
He wants to sell some in the expected bull run.
He thinks of selling liniarly: 1 BTC at price 80.000, 1 at 90.000, 1 at 100.000 and so on until all has been sold.
He wants to know both; How much cash he'll make when btc price goes to infinity and when it only goes to 101.000 before going down a lot for another bear market (crypto winter).

This app requires input fields for:
1. total holdings of BTC.
2. desired amount of BTC to sell.
3. increments between sales (sell points at BTC prices).
4. amount per incremental sale. (this should enable liniar, progressive and degressive amounts).
# With progressive amounts I mean: with every next sale (at a higher price) the amount of BTC to sell is more.
5. Intended case scenario to test (the top of the bull market).
